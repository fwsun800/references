				<p>The Department of Health and the Welsh Assembly Government have asked the National Institute for Clinical Excellence (NICE or the Institute) to conduct an appraisal of alendronate, etidronate, risedronate, raloxifene, strontium ranelate and teriparatide for the secondary prevention of osteoporotic fragility fractures in postmenopausal women and provide guidance on its use to the NHS in England and Wales. The Appraisal Committee has had its first meeting to consider both the evidence submitted and the views put forward by the representatives nominated for this appraisal by professional organisations and patient/carer and service user organisations. The Committee has developed preliminary recommendations on the use of alendronate, etidronate, risedronate, raloxifene, strontium ranelate and teriparatide for the secondary prevention of osteoporotic fragility fractures in postmenopausal women.</p>
				<p><strong>This document has been prepared for consultation with the formal consultees.</strong> It summarises the evidence and views that have been considered and sets out the preliminary recommendations developed by the Committee. The Institute is now inviting comments from the formal consultees in the appraisal process (the consultees for this appraisal are listed on the NICE website, <a href="https://www.nice.org.uk/" nice-original-href="http://www.nice.org.uk/">www.nice.org.uk</a>).</p>
				<p><strong>Note that this document does not constitute the Institute's formal guidance on this technology. The recommendations made in Section 1 are preliminary and may change after consultation.</strong></p>
				<p>The process the Institute will follow after the consultation period is summarised below. For further details, see the <em><a href="https://www.nice.org.uk/proxy/?sourceUrl=http%3a%2f%2fwww.nice.org.uk%2fpage.aspx%3fo%3d201972" nice-original-href="http://www.nice.org.uk/page.aspx?o=201972">Guide to the Technology Appraisal Process</a></em> (this document is available on the Institute's website, <a href="https://www.nice.org.uk/" nice-original-href="http://www.nice.org.uk/">www.nice.org.uk</a>).</p>
				<ul>
					<li>The Appraisal Committee will meet again to consider the original evidence and this Appraisal Consultation Document in the light of the views of the formal consultees.</li>
					<li>At that meeting, the Committee will also consider comments made on the document by people who are not formal consultees in the appraisal process.</li>
					<li>After considering feedback from the consultation process, the Committee will prepare the Final Appraisal Determination (FAD) and submit it to the Institute.</li>
					<li>Subject to any appeal by consultees, the FAD may be used as the basis for the Institute's guidance on the use of the appraised technology in the NHS in England and Wales.</li>
				</ul>
				<p><strong>The key dates for this appraisal are:</strong><br> Closing date for comments: 21 October 2005<br> Second Appraisal Committee meeting: 1 November 2005</p>
				<p>Details of membership of the Appraisal Committee are given in Appendix A and a list of the sources of evidence used in the preparation of this document is given in Appendix B.</p>

			<td>Clinical risk factors other than age and T-score also contribute to the risk of fracture. Although absolute risk of fracture provides an overall measure of fracture risk, the economic modelling revealed that absolute risk is not a precise indicator of cost effectiveness. This is because absolute risk covers all fracture sites included in the analysis, but different fracture sites have different impacts on quality of life, costs and mortality; the ratio of the risks for hip to non-hip fracture changes with age; different risk factors have different effects on hip and non-hip fractures, and this effect changes with age. Absolute risk intervention thresholds therefore differ slightly for each individual risk factor and for each risk factor combination. Every possible combination of age, T-score and risk factor(s) has its own intervention threshold. The clinical risk factors included in the modelling were current smoking, alcohol intake of more than 2 units per day, ever use of corticosteroids, parental history of hip fracture and rheumatoid arthritis.</td>

For women between the ages of 65 and 74 years, the Committee considered that alternative causes of fragility fracture should be excluded and therefore treatment is recommended when a T score of -2.5 SD or below is established by DXA scanning.

This risk can be recognised as a very low T-score (approximately -3 SD or below). Alternatively, such increased risk can be recognised as confirmed osteoporosis plus one, or more, additional clinical risk factor: parental history of hip fracture; and medical conditions independently associated with bone loss, such as rheumatoid arthritis.
